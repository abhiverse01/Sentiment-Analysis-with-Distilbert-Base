# Sentiment Analysis with DistilBERT

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing sentiment analysis using the DistilBERT model. The notebook demonstrates the process of fine-tuning DistilBERT for text classification tasks, specifically for sentiment analysis.

## Project Overview

Sentiment analysis is a common task in natural language processing (NLP) where the goal is to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. This notebook leverages the pre-trained DistilBERT model, which is a smaller, faster, and lighter version of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).

## Notebook Contents

The notebook includes the following sections:

1. **Introduction**: Brief overview of the project and objectives.
2. **Setup**: Installation and import of necessary libraries and packages.
3. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Loading the dataset and preprocessing the text data for model training.
4. **Model Setup**: Initializing the DistilBERT model and preparing it for fine-tuning.
5. **Training**: Fine-tuning the DistilBERT model on the sentiment analysis dataset.
6. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the model on the validation/test dataset.
7. **Inference**: Making predictions on new text data using the trained model.

## How to Use
